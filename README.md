# tT
A simple Time Tracker.
It aims to stay basic and intuitive, with a focus on keyboard usage.

## Installation
You can download binaries for your platform from https://github.com/pm98zz-c/tT/releases.

## Usage
Start by free typing your current activity in the main input field, and press Enter to start the timer.
See also the keyboard navigation reference: https://github.com/pm98zz-c/tT/blob/master/Keyboard.md.

To delete an existing time entry, either "blank" the task description, or set the start and end time to overlap.

## Redmine integration
You can enable pulling tasks from a Redmine server by entering credentials in the Edit > Preferences panels. Note this is uni-directional and only pulls the issues from Redmine for auto-completion. It does NOT create time entries from local records.
